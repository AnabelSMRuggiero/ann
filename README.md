# Project Goals

- Header only library
- Have only the C++ Standard Library as a dependancy
- Produce generic and efficient implementations

This project uses the C++20 standard. I do have some manually vectorized functions using compiler intrinsics located in immintrin.h; a project goal will be to make these functions vectorized in a more generic way.

# Licensing

Despite not updating the statements on these files quite yet, the intent was to spin these off into their own repo to release separately under the Apache 2.0 w/LLVM exception license.
